# IRCCloud Desktop

This is a prototype of an IRCCloud desktop app, currently available for
Windows and MacOS X. The app wraps the IRCCloud website in a native window.

This app is currently experimental and is not officially supported,
however it should provide equivalent or better functionality to other
IRCCloud desktop wrapper apps.

If you have any issues, please file them in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/irccloud/irccloud-desktop/issues).
